This repository contains the teaching material and other info associated with the "HRI Researchers - Introduction to Microcontrollers and Environmental Sensing Workshop" to be held on November 7, 2018 in HRI 127 at Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi.

#### If you will be participating in the November 7 workshop, you should prepare your laptop with the software that is needed before the event (instructions below). We will be using the “Arduino IDE” (IDE=integrated development environment), or for short, just “Arduino software”, which is freely available for Windows or Mac OS X (and Linux, too!).
